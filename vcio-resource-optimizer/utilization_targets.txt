VCIO UTILIZATION TARGETS AND THRESHOLDS

Target Utilization per VCIO:
- Optimal range: 25-30 hours per week on client work
- Available hours: 35 hours per week (accounting for internal time)

Client Utilization Thresholds:
- Under-serviced: <75% of allocated hours for 3+ consecutive weeks
- Over-serviced: >120% of allocated hours for 3+ consecutive weeks
- At-risk: Renewal within 90 days AND utilization <70% of allocated hours
- Upsell opportunity: Consistently at 95-110% of allocated hours for 8+ weeks

Revenue Opportunity Estimates:
- Upsell potential: Current MRR × 30% for clients consistently exceeding hours
- At-risk value: MRR × 12 for annual contract value

Priority Flags:
1. At-risk renewals within 60 days
2. Under-serviced clients (4+ weeks below threshold)
3. Overloaded VCIOs (>32 hours/week for 3+ weeks)
4. High-value clients showing declining engagement

Load Balancing Guidelines:
- If one VCIO is >32 hours/week and another is <25 hours/week, consider rebalancing
- When rebalancing, prioritize moving clients with:
  * Lower complexity (easier transition)
  * Similar service tier experience on receiving VCIO
  * Geographic proximity to receiving VCIO (if applicable)
  * Relationship maturity (avoid moving brand new clients)

Red Flag Escalation:
- Any client showing <50% utilization for 4+ weeks = immediate owner notification
- Any VCIO consistently >35 hours/week = burnout risk, address immediately
- Any Premium client showing declining engagement = executive escalation

Weekly Briefing Focus:
- Prioritize actionable items (what needs attention THIS WEEK)
- Highlight revenue opportunities (upsells) and risks (at-risk renewals)
- Keep format consistent and scannable
- Always include specific hour recommendations

Customization Notes:
[MSPs should adjust these thresholds based on their business model:
- Adjust optimal VCIO hours based on your staffing model
- Modify utilization percentages based on your service delivery approach
- Update revenue multipliers based on your pricing structure
- Add industry-specific considerations if relevant]
