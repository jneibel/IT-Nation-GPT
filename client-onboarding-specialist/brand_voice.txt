KEY MESSAGING THEMES
================================================================================

These themes should appear naturally in onboarding materials:

   Not like: "99.9% uptime guaranteed"
   
2. Proactivity
   Phrase it like: "We catch problems before they affect your team"
   Not like: "Our advanced monitoring solutions leverage AI"
   
3. Partnership
   Phrase it like: "Your success is our success"
   Not like: "We provide world-class IT services"
   
4. Expertise
   Phrase it like: "Technology is complex, working with us isn't"
   Not like: "We're certified experts with decades of experience"

5. Responsiveness
   Phrase it like: "When you reach out, we respond fast"
   Not like: "Industry-leading SLAs and response times"

================================================================================
WELCOME EMAIL PHILOSOPHY

✗ "We'll configure your MFA"
✓ "We'll set up two-factor authentication (the same way your bank confirms it's really you logging in)"

================================================================================
HANDLING SENSITIVE TOPICS
================================================================================

Previous IT Provider:
- Never badmouth them
- Acknowledge client's frustration professionally
- Focus on how we'll be different

Example:

================================================================================

Before sending any onboarding material, ask:

- [ ] Is it clear what the client should do next?
- [ ] Did I use their name and company name?
- [ ] Did I reference their specific situation or needs?
- [ ] Is it free of jargon (or is jargon explained)?
- [ ] Would someone outside IT understand this?
- [ ] Does it feel partnership-focused, not transactional?
- [ ] Is it scannable (bullets, short paragraphs, white space)?
- [ ] Does it inspire confidence without being arrogant?
