## How to Use These Materials

### Step 1: Choose Your Starting Point
Pick the use case that solves your biggest pain point right now. Don't try to build all four at once.

### Step 2: Customize the Instructions
Every instruction set includes `[MSP_NAME]` and `[CUSTOMIZE_THIS]` placeholders. Replace these with your actual company info, service tiers, processes, and terminology.

**Critical:** Generic instructions produce generic results. The more you customize for YOUR MSP, the better your Custom GPT will perform.

### Step 3: Create Your Knowledge Base Files
Each scenario includes template files (CSV, TXT, etc.). These are starting points:
- Use the same file formats (CSV for structured data, TXT for context/guidelines)
- Keep column names consistent in CSVs
- Don't overcomplicate - simpler is better

### Step 4: Build and Test
1. Go to ChatGPT (Plus or Team/Enterprise account required)
2. Create a new Custom GPT
3. Paste in your customized instructions
4. Upload your knowledge base files
5. Test with real scenarios from your business
6. Iterate based on results

### Step 5: Deploy and Refine
Custom GPTs aren't "set it and forget it." As you use them:
- Note what works and what doesn't
- Update instructions to fix issues
- Add new knowledge base content as needed
- Test changes before rolling out to your team

## Important Notes

### File Formats Matter
**✔️ Best formats:**
- `.txt` for guidelines, procedures, context
- `.csv` for structured data (clients, tickets, pricing)
- `.docx` for longer documents (if needed)

**❌ Avoid:**
- Excel workbooks with multiple tabs (GPT struggles with these)
- PDFs with complex formatting
- Images of text (GPT can't reliably extract)

### Privacy and Security
**These Custom GPTs use OpenAI's infrastructure.** Consider:
- Don't upload real client data for testing (use anonymized or fake data)
- Review OpenAI's data usage policies for your account type
- For highly sensitive use cases, consider alternatives like Claude Projects (we'll discuss in the workshop)

### When Custom GPTs Aren't the Answer
Custom GPTs are powerful but not universal solutions:
- **Don't use them for:** Real-time automation, API integrations, complex multi-step workflows
- **Do use them for:** Content generation, analysis, triage, document creation, knowledge base Q&A

If you need actual automation (not just generation), you need AI Agents or workflow tools.

**Remember:** The difference between a Custom GPT that works and one that fails comes down to specific instructions, clean data formats, and testing. Don't rush the customization step.

Now go build something useful.
