================================================================================
TRIAGE TIPS FOR COMMON SCENARIOS
================================================================================

"Everything is Slow":
- Ask: Computer, network, or specific application?
- Single user = P3, multiple users = P2
- Check: recent updates, internet speed, server load

"I Can't Log In":
- Check: account locked vs. wrong password vs. system down
- Verify identity before resetting
- If system down (multiple users can't log in) = P2

"My Computer Won't Start":
- Remote user or in office?
- Blue screen, black screen, or won't power on?
- Can they work from another device?
- Priority depends on user criticality and availability of backup device

"I Got a Weird Email":
- If they clicked or downloaded = P2 security concern
- If just received and suspicious = P4 (educate and delete)
- Forward to security team for analysis

"Nothing Works":
- Clarify: truly nothing or specific things?
- Check scope: just them or multiple users?
- If actually nothing = P1
- Usually it's "several things" = P2

================================================================================
WHEN IN DOUBT
================================================================================

If you're unsure about priority:
1. Ask yourself: "What happens if this isn't fixed in the next hour?"
2. Consider business impact over technical severity
3. It's better to escalate and have it de-escalated than miss a critical issue
4. Get a second opinion from senior tech or supervisor

Remember: Priority can change as more information is gathered
- "Printer down" (P3) can become "Shipping labels won't print, trucks waiting" (P2)
- "Computer slow" (P3) can become "Entire sales team can't access CRM" (P1)

Always gather context before finalizing priority.
